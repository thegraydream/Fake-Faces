# 🔧 Easy Installation 
All you need to install the program is python 3! 
The modules will install automatically!

# 💎 Configuration
When you launch the software, a config.json file will be created in this format:
`{
    "log": true,
    "version": true
}`\
In it you can set **log** to **False**, you will no longer see the software logs.\
you can also set the **version** to **False**, and the software will never ask you to use the latest version again.

# 🎈 Usage
To use it, you just need to call the **"fake_faces(number of image, path of export, file name)"** function from any program using **"from FakeFaces import fake_faces"**.

# 📜 Other Information
The software can be updated directly from the program!
You can use fake_faces function with 0 argument (default nb = 1, default path = '.', default file = timestamp)!
This programme uses the [](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) website to generate fake faces.
